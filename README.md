# Namaste React

# Parcel

- Creates a dev build
- Creates a local server
- It is doing HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- File watching algo (written in c++)
- Caching - faster builds
- Image optimisation
- Minification, bundling, compressing of our files
- Consistant hashing (Consistent hashing is a smart way to distribute data across multiple servers so that when servers are added or removed, only a small amount of data needs to move instead of everything being shuffled around. It arranges servers in a ring.)
- Code splitting
- Differential Bundling (when your app is hosted it can be opened on all browsers or older versions of it)
- Error Handling
- HTTPs support
- Tree Shaking - remove unused code
- Different dev and prod build
